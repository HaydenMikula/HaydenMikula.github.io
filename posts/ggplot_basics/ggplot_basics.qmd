### Aesthetic Mappings

In ggplot, there are certain aesthetics that can be mapped to the data of a visualization. Some of these aesthetics are:

- Size (in millimeters)
- Shape (from 0 to 25, see below)
- Color
- Fill
- Alpha Transparency (from 0 to 1)

Aesthetics can be mapped uniformly to all data, or split up according to certain categorical observations that exist within the data set.

This applies to all aesthetic values that can be altered.

```{r}
# Uniform
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = hwy,
                       y = displ)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue")
```

```{r}
# Split
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = hwy,
                       y = displ,
                       color = class)) +
  geom_point()
```


### Facet Wrapping

To split our visualization by a certain categorical variable, we can use facet_wrap(~var)

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = 
               aes(x = displ, 
                   y = hwy), 
             alpha = .5) + 
  facet_wrap(~class)
```

Similarly, we can split a visualization across 2 variables using facet_grid(var1~var2)

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = 
               aes(x = displ, 
                   y = hwy),
             alpha = .5) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

### Geometric Objects

Using the different kinds of geom_*() functions, we can visualize data in multiple ways

Examples of geom_*() functions:

- geom_bar(): Bar Chart
- geom_histogram(): Histogram
- geom_line(): Line Graph
- geom_boxplot(): Box Plot
- geom_point(): Scatterplot
- geom_smooth(): Fitted Line (with error range)

Multiple of each geom_*() can be used in a visualization to represent data differently

```{r}

```
