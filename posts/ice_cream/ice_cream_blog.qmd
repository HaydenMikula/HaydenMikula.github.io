## Descriptive Statistics

Let's take a look at the ice_cream Data Frame, which details Ben & Jerry's ice cream transactions across various regions and households:

```{r, message=FALSE}
ice_cream <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/ben-and-jerry-cleaned.csv')
```

Some descriptive statistics for the averages of Ice Cream Price, Coupon Discount, and Household Income are shown below for each of the available regions

```{r}
ice_cream |> filter(couponper1 > 0) |> group_by(region) |> 
  summarise(mean_price = mean(priceper1, na.rm=T),
            mean_coup = mean(couponper1, na.rm=T),
            mean_inc = mean(household_income, na.rm=T))
```

## Household Size and Ice Cream Purchases

Along with this, we'll look at a count of the prevalent household sizes in each region:

```{r}
ice_cream_n <- ice_cream |> group_by(region, household_size) |> count(household_size) |> arrange(-n)
ice_cream_n
```

```{r}
ggplot(ice_cream, aes(y = household_size,
                      fill = region)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,2,4,6,8)) +
  facet_wrap(~region) +
  labs(x = "# of Ice Cream Bought",
       y = "Household Size",
       fill = "Region",
       title = "Ice Cream Purchases by Regional Household Size") +
  scale_fill_tableau() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = 'gray90',
                                        color = 'transparent'))
```
From this, it appears that there is a consistent relationship where 2 person households purchase Ben & Jerry's the most, followed by 1, 3, 4, and 5 person households across the 4 regions. The South has the most purchases overall, and Central has the least.


## Marriage and Ice Cream Purchases

Similarly, we can visualize how purchases are influenced by the income and marriage status of each household:

```{r}
ice_cream2 <- ice_cream

ice_cream2$household_income <- as.factor(ice_cream2$household_income)

ggplot(ice_cream2, aes(y = household_income,
                      fill = married)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "# of Ice Cream Bought",
       y = "Household Income Bracket (in dollars)",
       title = "Ice Cream Purchases by Income Bracket",
       fill = "Married") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = T)) +
  scale_fill_tableau() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```
This shows that many of Ben & Jerry's sales come from households between an income range of $70,000-$140,000 (because the 130,000 income bracket covers from 130,000 to 140,000), and that the ratio of married to unmarried households is much higher as incomes become lower. 

Visualizing this with a "filled" bar chart, we can more easily notice this relationship, where there is a high percentage of married, low income households:

```{r}
inc_married_pct <- ice_cream |> group_by(household_income, married) |> summarise(n = n()) |> mutate(pct = n / sum(n))

ggplot(inc_married_pct, aes(x = pct,
                        y = reorder(household_income, pct),
                        fill = married)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_fill_tableau() +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Household Income Bracket (in dollars)",
       fill = "Married",
       title = "Married Households Across Income Brackets") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
